# Tverbergs-Theorm-in-the-Plane
An end of Semester Project for CSE 4704 (Spring 2019)

This project is to present a visual reference of Tverberg's Theorem in a 2-Dimensional Plane.

Tverberg's Theorem states that sufficiently many points in d-dimensional Euclidean space can be partitioned into subsets with intersecting convex hulls. Specifically, for any set of:

(d+1)(r-1)+1 

points there exists a point x (not necessarily one of the given points) and a partition of the given points into r subsets, such that x belongs to the convex hull of all of the subsets.
